I want to implement multiple new features inside the web-app. I will list them down bellow and your job is to create a comprehensive plan for their full implementation that a ralph-loop  
 can follow. The features that will be implemented need to be presented in structured form. Each of the features needs to have task, expected result from the final task and well defined  
 needed steps for the right implementation of the feature based on the project structure. Features can be split in multiple tasks. Each task have to be able to fit in a single context  
 window so the model doesnt lose track on mid of the implementation. Use the web if you need to clarify what is the best way to strcuture the plan so ralph-wiggum loop follows and
understands it. Describe also if there must be DB changes that the ai agent needs to make for the futures to work correctly. Those are the features i want to be implemented:

1. (Payment processing using Stripe) The payment system needs to be implemented inside the profile page using stripe. The system needs to use Google pay or Apple pay based on the device.  
   After payment user will be granted premium access to the app (add visual clue so the user knows he has premium enabled). This will determine features that are not yet implemented nor determined. Add the payment logic for now.
2. (Users gallery modification) The user must be able to choose which photos he has posted can be public and private. Private photos can be seen only from payed users. Each user must
   be able to view other user's profile gallery like in instagram. Private photos need to apear blured so are unrecognizable from unpaid users.
