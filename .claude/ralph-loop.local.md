Based on the implementations.md plan I created, here's a good prompt for the ralph-loop:

Implement the features from implementations.md following the task order. Start with Task 1.1 (Database Schema for Premium), then proceed sequentially through all tasks. For each task: read the task details from implementations.md, implement the code changes, run type verification, and mark completion before moving to the next task.

Or a shorter version:

Execute implementations.md tasks in order. Start at Task 1.1 and proceed through Task 2.8. Apply migrations, create files, and modify code as specified in each task.
